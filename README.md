# HTML5 Cube #

An animated 3D Cube made with CSS3 only - no JavaScript involved.

## Background ##

This Cube is a demonstration of CSS3 possibilities. It's made with HTML and CSS3 only. No JavaScript involved.

This page makes usage of:

* [CSS3 Transitions](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/)
* [CSS3 3D Transforms](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-3d-transforms/)
* [CSS3 Animations](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-animations/)
* [CSS3 Multiple Backgrounds](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-background/)
* [CSS3 Radial/Linear Gradients](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-images/#gradients)
* [CSS3 Selectors](http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/)
* SVG Images

Because most of this feature are still in draft status, I've added the CSS with [vendor extensions](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-syntax/#vendor-specific) for all common browsers (-webkit-, -moz-, -ms- and -o-) and the pure W3C properties.

It's not intended to get this page perfectly rendered with all current browsers. It should visualize the state of CSS3 support in todays browsers.

## Browser Support ##

Following Browsers should be able to run this demo correct:

* Chrome 16
* Safari 5
* Firefox 10
* Internet Explorer 10
* Mobile Safari @ iOS 5
* Android Browser @ Android 4

For marketing people it's named "HTML5" ;-)
